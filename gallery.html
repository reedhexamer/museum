    <figcaption>"I was pacing in front of the dorms hoping my crush would suddenly walk out and sweep me into a romantic kiss goodbye, when I gave up and planted myself in the commons. I took this photo because I wanted to document something sweet and lovely that I never would have noticed unless I was glum enough to look down, and as something to post on instagram to remind him of me. (I ended up reflecting on how ridiculous I was behaving and sent it/any prospect of our relationship straight to the trash, instead.)"</figcaption>

I was on the phone with my dad, who just told me about an opportunity to meet with the founders of an LA tech startup that happened to be in my hometown. I'll be meeting them this week, now that I'm moved back home for summer. I have no idea what my future holds, but it's evenings like this which remind to not get caught worrying about tomorrow, but to remember to enjoy today."</figcaption>
